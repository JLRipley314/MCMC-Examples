# Markov chain Monte-Carlo Examples

Example implementation of MCMC algorithms.
These examples are essentially (partial) solutions to "MCMC\_Problems.pdf", which are a set of problems written up by [Neil Cornish](https://physics.montana.edu/directory/faculty/1524008/neil-cornish). 
The examples are written as [Pluto notebooks](https://plutojl.org/), which is a "reactive" notebook for Julia applications.
